## 2026-07-08 — Production deploy attempt blocked by SSH reachability

**Deployed:** NO
**Risk:** LOW to production, MEDIUM operationally

### Changes

- Ran `bash deploy-blue-green.sh` from `main` at commit `c9c982c6`.
- Local QA gate passed.
- Tightened `deploy-blue-green.sh` once more so an empty remote slot-detection result now falls back to `slot=blue` and `port=3000`.
- Restored env-driven SSH port support across `deploy-blue-green.sh`, `deploy-vps-auto.sh`, `deploy-staging.sh`, and `scripts/automation/automation/ssh_client.py`.
- Added a short SSH reachability preflight to the deploy entrypoints so they fail before long QA runs when the remote target is unreachable.

### Findings

- The production site stayed healthy and continued serving commit `46f633b58783`.
- The blue-green deploy did not reach any nginx switch or PM2 mutation step.
- The blocker was external connectivity: the current configured SSH endpoint for `193.93.169.32` was unreachable from this environment.

### Verification

- `bash deploy-blue-green.sh` — stopped on SSH connection refusal after local QA
- `bash -n deploy-blue-green.sh`
- `bash -n deploy-vps-auto.sh`
- `bash -n deploy-staging.sh`
- `curl -s https://persiantoolbox.ir/api/health`
- `curl -s https://persiantoolbox.ir/api/version`
- `nc -vz 193.93.169.32 22` → connection refused

### Follow-up

- Set the correct `SSH_PORT` / `VPS_PORT` in the deploy environment if production SSH is not on port 22.
- Restore SSH reachability from the deploy environment before the next production attempt.
- Once SSH is back, rerun `bash deploy-blue-green.sh`; the app-side deploy logic is ready, and the remaining blocker is remote access.

## 2026-07-07 — Production deploy automation topology hardening

**Deployed:** NO
**Risk:** LOW

### Changes

- Hardened `deploy-vps-auto.sh` so legacy production deploys now detect the real PM2 runtime cwd for `persiantoolbox`.
- When production is running from `persiantoolbox-slot-blue` or `persiantoolbox-slot-green`, the script now updates that active slot symlink before PM2 restart instead of only switching `/home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox`.
- Added active-runtime-link rollback handling so an automatic rollback restores both the stable live symlinks and the slot symlink actually used by PM2.
- Hardened `deploy-blue-green.sh` slot detection to read:
  - active port from nginx upstream config or direct proxy config
  - active slot from the live PM2 cwd
- Updated `deploy-blue-green.sh` nginx migration step to patch both `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/projects` and `/etc/nginx/sites-available/projects`.
- Updated `health-monitor.sh` so it can detect a direct `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000` setup when the upstream file is absent.

### Findings

- The production mismatch was caused by a real topology split: nginx/static aliases still rely on `/home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox`, while the live PM2 app cwd was `/home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox-slot-blue`.
- In that state, a legacy deploy could build a correct release and still fail commit verification because PM2 kept serving the older slot target.
- The new script logic matches the live server state observed on 2026-07-07: runtime cwd `slot-blue`, public traffic on port `3000`.

### Verification

- `bash -n deploy-vps-auto.sh`
- `bash -n deploy-blue-green.sh`
- `bash -n health-monitor.sh`
- Remote topology smoke:
  - PM2 runtime cwd resolved to `/home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox-slot-blue`
  - nginx active public port resolved to `3000`

### Follow-up

- The next production deploy can use the hardened legacy path more safely, but explicit approval and the full public verification checklist still remain mandatory.
- Blue-green is still the target model; the next zero-downtime cutover should switch nginx fully to upstream-backed routing and then be re-verified end to end.

## 2026-07-07 — Staging deploy verification + production path risk clarification

**Deployed:** YES (staging only via `bash deploy-staging.sh`)
**Risk:** LOW for staging, MEDIUM for next production deploy until server config is reconciled
**Staging:** https://staging.persiantoolbox.ir
**Staging commit:** `09d0c040e85b`

### Changes

- Hardened `deploy-staging.sh` so staging deploys now enforce the same preflight discipline as production:
  - dirty-worktree guard
  - local QA gate (`pwa:shell:check`, `pwa:sw:validate`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `vitest`)
  - release metadata generation in `.env.release`
  - commit/branch/build timestamp injection into the build
  - PM2 restart through `ecosystem.config.js` with `PM2_PROCESS_NAME=persiantoolbox-staging`
  - mandatory public verification of health, version, key pages, CSS, font, and PDF worker
- Restored staging traceability so `/api/health` and `/api/version` expose the live commit, branch, and build timestamp.

### Findings

- Staging was healthy before deploy but lacked release metadata (`commit`, `branch`, `builtAt` were `null`), which made it unsuitable as a reliable pre-production verification target.
- The current VPS production setup does not fully match the repo's documented blue-green assumptions:
  - `persiantoolbox.ir` nginx still proxies directly to `127.0.0.1:3000`
  - production static aliases still point at `/home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox/...`
  - PM2 still has a legacy `persiantoolbox` process on port `3000`
  - the `persiantoolbox-blue` process is present but not currently usable as an active slot baseline
- Because of that drift, staging was deployed and verified, but production was intentionally not switched in this session.

### Verification

- `bash -n deploy-staging.sh`
- `pnpm pwa:shell:check`
- `pnpm pwa:sw:validate`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm vitest --run`
- `bash deploy-staging.sh`
- Public staging verification passed:
  - `/api/health` returned OK with commit `09d0c040e85b`
  - `/api/version` returned commit `09d0c040e85b`
  - `/`, `/blog`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/pricing`, `/tools`, `/contract-tools`, `/contract-tools/salon-contract`, `/contract-tools/vehicle-sale`, `/writing-tools/persian-writing-studio` returned HTTP 200
  - staging CSS, `Vazirmatn-Bold.woff2`, and `pdf.worker.min.mjs` returned HTTP 200

### Follow-up

- Reconcile the VPS nginx + PM2 production topology with the documented blue-green model before the next zero-downtime production deploy.
- Until that is done, treat `deploy-blue-green.sh` as not yet authoritative for this server state.
- If a production deploy is required before reconciliation, use the release-based legacy path only with explicit approval and post-deploy verification.

## 2026-07-07 — Production release sync after docs-only deploy attempt

**Deployed:** PARTIAL
**Risk:** LOW
**Production:** https://persiantoolbox.ir
**Live commit:** `46f633b58783`

### Changes

- Ran the release-based production deploy path against the current `main` tip.
- The deploy build completed, but the live commit check intentionally failed because the runtime was still serving the active `slot-blue` release rather than the docs-only HEAD release.
- Reconciled the live symlinks so `/home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox` and `/home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox-current` now point to the active `slot-blue` release directory.

### Findings

- The production runtime is now consistently identified as release `46f633b58783`.
- The failed deploy did not leave the site in a half-switched state; the active app and the public version endpoint are aligned again.
- The docs-only commit `161c512a20b7` should not be treated as a required runtime promotion on its own.

### Verification

- `https://persiantoolbox.ir/api/version` returned commit `46f633b58783`
- `readlink -f /home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox`
- `readlink -f /home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox-current`
- `readlink -f /home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox-slot-blue`

### Follow-up

- Keep using the release-based path for production until the blue-green orchestration and the live VPS topology are fully aligned.
- Avoid using commit equality on docs-only changes as a deploy success criterion for runtime promotion.

## 2026-07-06 — Staging recovery + PM2/blue-green hardening

**Deployed:** NO
**Risk:** LOW

### Changes

- Restored staging deploy flow and verified `https://staging.persiantoolbox.ir` with health, key pages, CSS, font, and worker checks.
- Tightened `useSubscriptionStatus` normalization so legacy subscription payloads only resolve to premium when `active=true`, `usage.isPremium=true`, or a future `expiresAt` exists for a known plan.
- Made `ecosystem.config.js` process name configurable through `PM2_PROCESS_NAME` so blue-green slots can run as stable PM2 identities.
- Updated `deploy-blue-green.sh` to restart existing slot processes in place instead of delete/start churn, while keeping cleanup of the inactive slot after nginx switch.
- Updated `health-monitor.sh` to detect the active nginx upstream port and restart the matching blue/green PM2 process instead of assuming legacy `persiantoolbox` on port 3000.

### Findings

- Historical staging restart spikes were driven by repeated `EADDRINUSE` on port `3001`.
- Production PM2 state had drift: the active app directory was a blue/green slot, but the monitor still targeted legacy process/port assumptions.
- No current evidence that static asset copying is broken in the active release path; CSS/font/worker checks passed on both production and staging after the deploy script fixes.

### Verification

- `pnpm vitest --run tests/unit/subscription-status-contract.test.ts tests/unit/home-role-path-analytics.test.tsx tests/unit/analytics-store-security.test.ts tests/unit/admin-analytics-route.test.ts tests/unit/admin-funnel-route.test.ts`
- `bash -n deploy-blue-green.sh && bash -n health-monitor.sh`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm build`

### Follow-up

- Push `main` once remote connectivity stops hanging from the current environment.
- Run the next approved production deploy with the hardened blue-green script so the slot-aware PM2 naming is applied on the VPS.

## 2026-07-05 — CSP enforcement: nonce-based script-src + blue-green deploy

**Deployed:** YES (via `bash deploy-blue-green.sh`)
**Risk:** MEDIUM (CSP policy change affects all inline scripts)
**Production:** https://persiantoolbox.ir
**Production commit:** `5f7418285869`

### Changes

- CSP script-src changed from `'unsafe-inline'` to nonce-based (`'nonce-...'`)
- Layout reads nonce from request headers via `getCspNonce()`
- All `<Script>` components receive nonce prop
- `buildCsp(nonce)` and `buildReportOnlyCsp(nonce)` now require nonce parameter
- style-src keeps `'unsafe-inline'` (required by Next.js hydration)
- Blue-green deploy tested successfully with nginx upstream switching

### Verification

- `pnpm typecheck` — PASS
- `pnpm lint` — PASS (0 errors)
- `pnpm vitest --run` — PASS, 149 files / 1263 tests
- `pnpm build` — PASS, 869 pages
- Production deploy — PASS, commit `5f7418285869`
- CSP header verified: `script-src 'self' 'nonce-...'` (no unsafe-inline)
- All key pages HTTP 200
- Blue-green switch completed in <1s

### Rollback

- Revert commit `5f7418285869` and redeploy. No database changes.

## 2026-07-05 — GSC dead-link cleanup: pdf-tools redirects, font cleanup, 301 redirects

**Deployed:** YES (via `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh` — first attempt timed out during OG build, fixed emoji CDN issue and redeployed successfully)
**Risk:** LOW (redirects only, no page logic changes)
**Production:** https://persiantoolbox.ir
**Production commit:** `c3e207c5d0f0`

### Diagnosis

- Google Search Console reported 31 server errors (5xx), 24 not-found (404), 5 duplicate-without-canonical, and 1 blocked-by-robots errors.
- Live testing confirmed: most 5xx URLs returned 200 on current server (transient). 7 pdf-tools subcategory paths (`/pdf-tools/compress`, `/edit`, `/extract`, `/security`, `/watermark`, `/convert`, `/split`) returned 404 because no `page.tsx` existed for them.
- Old font files `fonnts.com-IRANSansXBold.woff2`, `fonnts.com-IRANSansXRegular.woff2`, `fonnts.com-IRANSansXRegular.ttf` existed in `public/fonts/` but were not referenced in CSS `@font-face` or any code. Google crawled `/fonts/fonnts.com-IRANSansXBold.ttf` which never existed, causing 5xx.
- `Vazirmatn-Regular.ttf` existed in `public/fonts/` but was not referenced anywhere (CSS uses `.woff2`). `Vazirmatn-Bold.ttf` is still required by `lib/og-font.ts` for OG image generation.
- Internal links (`lib/navigation.ts`, footer, sitemap) had zero references to dead URLs. The dead URLs were only from external Google crawl.
- Canonical tags for `?lang=` and `?q=` parameters already pointed to clean URLs. www→non-www 301 redirect was already active in nginx.

### Changes

- Created 7 pdf-tools subcategory redirect pages (`page.tsx` using `next/navigation` `redirect()`):
  - `/pdf-tools/compress` → `/pdf-tools/compress/compress-pdf`
  - `/pdf-tools/edit` → `/pdf-tools/edit/add-page-numbers`
  - `/pdf-tools/extract` → `/pdf-tools/extract/extract-text`
  - `/pdf-tools/security` → `/pdf-tools/security/encrypt-pdf`
  - `/pdf-tools/watermark` → `/pdf-tools/watermark/add-watermark`
  - `/pdf-tools/convert` → `/pdf-tools/convert/pdf-to-text`
  - `/pdf-tools/split` → `/pdf-tools/split/split-pdf`
- Added 12 permanent redirects in `next.config.mjs` for crawled dead URLs:
  - `/asdev-portfolio` → `/asdev`
  - `/brand/asdev-portfolio` → `/asdev`
  - `/contract-tools/rental-contract` → `/contract-tools/lease-agreement`
  - `/legal-documents` → `/contract-tools`
  - `/pdf-tools/edit/add-header-footer` → `/pdf-tools/edit/add-page-numbers`
  - `/pdf-tools/paginate` → `/pdf-tools/edit`
  - `/pdf-tools/paginate/add-page-numbers` → `/pdf-tools/edit/add-page-numbers`
  - `/topics/date-tools` → `/date-tools`
  - `/topics/finance-tools` → `/tools`
  - `/topics/pdf-tools` → `/pdf-tools`
  - `/topics/image-tools` → `/image-tools`
  - `/topics/text-tools` → `/text-tools`
- Removed IRANSansX `@font-face` declarations from `globals.css` and removed `IRANSansX` from `--font-sans` stack.
- Deleted 4 unused font files: `fonnts.com-IRANSansXBold.woff2`, `fonnts.com-IRANSansXRegular.woff2`, `fonnts.com-IRANSansXRegular.ttf`, `Vazirmatn-Regular.ttf`.
- Updated `tests/unit/next-config-redirects.test.ts` (redirect count 8 → 20).
- Replaced emoji glyph 🧰 with text mark "PT" in `lib/og-image.tsx` `createToolOgImage` to prevent satori from fetching emoji from `cdn.jsdelivr.net` during VPS build (ConnectTimeout killed the 876-page build on first deploy attempt).

### Verification

- `pnpm typecheck` — PASS
- `pnpm lint` — PASS (0 errors, pre-existing warnings only)
- `pnpm vitest --run` — PASS, 149 files / 1263 tests
- `pnpm build` — PASS
- `bash -n deploy-vps-auto.sh` — PASS
- `bash -n quick-deploy.sh` — PASS
- Live URL testing: all 708 sitemap URLs return 200, all 26 nav links return 200, all 12 footer links return 200, all 11 topic categories return 200, all 10 guides return 200, 30 sampled tool pages return 200.
- Sitemap has zero dead URLs.
- Canonical tags for `?lang=` and `?q=` params already point to clean URLs.
- www→non-www 301 redirect confirmed active.
- Production deploy: `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh` — PASS (second attempt after emoji fix).
- 876 pages generated, 1 CSS, 202 JS, 6 fonts, PDF worker present.
- PM2 online, commit `c3e207c5d0f0` verified in `/api/health` and `/api/version`.
- All other services on the VPS (asdev-audit-ir, devatlas, my-portfolio) unaffected.

### Rollback

- Revert commit `9e3cb7e9` and redeploy. No database or storage changes.

## 2026-07-05 — Homepage/blog initial-load reduction and hardened deploy automation

**Deployed:** YES (via hardened `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh` after local gates)
**Risk:** MEDIUM (homepage/blog payload and production deploy path changed)
**Production:** https://persiantoolbox.ir
**Production commit:** `61c46f9679e2`

### Diagnosis

- Live timing before this change showed warm TTFB around `1.3s-1.9s` on key pages and total HTML transfer around `361KB` for `/` and `417KB` for `/blog`.
- The previous PWA fix removed the service-worker request burst, but the site still felt slow on VPN because `/blog` serialized all article metadata to the client and the homepage loaded the tool-search bundle on the initial path.
- A loading spinner alone would only hide delay; the higher-impact fix is to reduce initial payload and hydrate secondary UI after the first paint.
- The legacy `quick-deploy.sh` still had its own rsync/build/restart flow, which could bypass newer QA, rollback, cache purge, and public verification checks.
- Production deploy dry-runs exposed two deployment gaps before traffic was switched:
  - PM2 kept serving the old cwd/exec path when asked to restart an already-known process from a different release directory.
  - `/blog/opengraph-image` could fail production build if the image renderer tried to fetch external emoji assets and the VPS could not reach that CDN quickly.

### Changes

- Added idle/interaction lazy hydration for homepage tool search, with a lightweight Persian placeholder before the full search bundle loads.
- Reduced `/blog` initial client payload: the first page receives only the first 12 posts, while search/filter/sort/pagination fetch the full static post index from `/api/blog/posts` on demand.
- Added `getHomepagePreviewPosts()` so homepage blog cards use a cached, focused preview selection instead of sorting all posts inside the component on every render.
- Added static revalidated `/api/blog/posts` endpoint for the deferred blog index.
- Regenerated the PWA shell manifest; it still contains only `/offline` and `/manifest.webmanifest`.
- Reworked `deploy-vps-auto.sh` into a release-based pipeline:
  - dirty-worktree guard
  - PWA/typecheck/lint/test QA gate
  - isolated release directory under `/home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox-releases`
  - release env metadata for `/api/version`
  - stable `/home/ubuntu/persiantoolbox` live symlink that points to the selected release, so PM2 can safely restart the same path while serving a new release
  - local warmup, public verification, nginx cache purge, and automatic rollback attempt on failed public verification
- Converted `quick-deploy.sh` into a wrapper for the hardened production deploy path.
- Updated `ecosystem.config.js` to read `.env` and `.env.release` from `PERSIANTOOLBOX_APP_DIR`, so PM2 can run the selected release directory cleanly.
- Removed emoji glyphs from the root/blog OG image routes and replaced them with text marks, keeping production image builds offline-safe.
- Updated `scripts/pwa/generate-shell-assets.ts` so generated JSON stays stable with the repository formatter and cannot break the deploy gate after pre-commit formatting.

### Verification

- `bash -n deploy-vps-auto.sh` — PASS
- `bash -n quick-deploy.sh` — PASS
- `pnpm exec eslint components/home/LazyToolSearch.tsx components/home/HomeHero.tsx components/home/BlogPreviewSection.tsx components/features/blog/BlogList.tsx components/features/blog/BlogListClient.tsx app/api/blog/posts/route.ts lib/blog.ts` — PASS with existing `lib/blog.ts` warnings only
- `pnpm typecheck` — PASS
- `pnpm pwa:shell:generate` — PASS, generated 2 routes/assets
- `pnpm pwa:shell:check` — PASS
- `pnpm pwa:sw:validate` — PASS
- `pnpm vitest --run` — PASS, 149 files / 1,263 tests
- `pnpm build` — PASS, 869 routes/pages generated
- Build output for `/blog` HTML is now about `300KB`; prior live `/blog` transfer measured about `417KB`.
- Production deploy `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh` — PASS, promoted `61c46f9679e2`.
- Mandatory post-deploy health sequence — PASS:
  - `/api/health` returned OK with database/Redis OK and `commit:"61c46f9679e2"`.
  - `/`, `/blog`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/pricing`, `/tools`, `/contract-tools`, `/contract-tools/salon-contract`, `/contract-tools/vehicle-sale`, `/writing-tools/persian-writing-studio` returned HTTP 200.
  - Homepage CSS, `Vazirmatn-Bold.woff2`, and `pdf.worker.min.mjs` returned HTTP 200.
- Post-deploy live timing samples:
  - `/`: `360566` bytes, total `3.57s-3.91s`
  - `/blog`: `299776` bytes, total `1.92s-3.62s`
  - `/tools`: `187883` bytes, total `2.31s-2.73s`
  - `/writing-tools/persian-writing-studio`: `80322` bytes, total `1.59s-1.65s`
  - `/api/blog/posts`: `122062` bytes, fetched only on demand by blog interactions

### Follow-up

- Run fresh production Lighthouse with throttling profiles after deploy.
- `/blog` can still be reduced further by splitting editorial/sidebar data and minimizing client-side `BlogCard` code.
- Homepage HTML remains large enough to justify another pass on below-the-fold sections, but the most obvious initial JS path is now deferred.
- The release-based deploy is safer, but rsync/build time is still long; next deploy automation pass should reduce transfer volume and reuse install artifacts more aggressively.

## 2026-07-05 — PWA install pre-cache throttling after 7.8.0 production slowness

**Deployed:** YES (`bash deploy-vps-auto.sh` twice: PWA throttling, then PDF route gap fix)
**Risk:** MEDIUM (production slowness and repeated PM2 restarts traced to client/service-worker load amplification)
**Production:** https://persiantoolbox.ir
**Production commits:** `25b462b9` (PWA install load fix), `1744a605` (PDF add page numbers route)

### Diagnosis

- Production health was OK, but PM2 showed repeated restarts and high heap pressure after the 7.8.0 deploy.
- Nginx access logs showed bursts of many tool-page requests with `sw.js` as referrer from a single client, including PDF/image/text/finance routes in the same second.
- Root cause: `public/sw.js` pre-cached a large generated shell of nearly all offline-guaranteed tool routes during service worker install. On slow/VPN clients this created a large parallel request burst before normal browsing could settle.
- The same list was generated by `scripts/pwa/generate-shell-assets.ts`, so editing `public/sw.js` alone would have been reverted by the next generate/build workflow.
- Live logs also exposed a stale indexed route gap: `/pdf-tools/edit/add-page-numbers` returned 404 while the registry, PDF uses page, and generated PWA shell expected it.

### Changes Deployed

- Reduced PWA install shell to only `/offline` and `/manifest.webmanifest`.
- Updated the generator and generated JSON so future `pnpm pwa:shell:generate` runs keep the shell small.
- Bumped service worker cache version to `v11-2026-07-05` to force clients off the heavy cache.
- Stopped treating HTML `Accept` requests as API-cacheable and bypassed `_rsc` requests so Next.js RSC traffic is not cached through the service worker.
- Lowered API runtime cache cap from 50 to 20.
- Tightened the unit contract to fail if broad tool routes return to the install shell.
- Added the canonical `/pdf-tools/edit/add-page-numbers` app route and OG image route, backed by the existing PDF page-numbering feature.
- Updated the PDF tools card link/category to the canonical edit path and extended the registry indexing test to require the route file.

### Verification

**Pre-deploy local gates:**

- `pnpm pwa:shell:generate` — PASS, generated 2 routes/assets
- `pnpm pwa:shell:check` — PASS
- `pnpm pwa:sw:validate` — PASS
- `pnpm vitest --run tests/unit/pwa-shell-assets-contract.test.ts tests/unit/sw-cache-version.test.ts tests/unit/sw-pro-policy.test.ts tests/hybrid/pwa-manifest-contract.test.ts` — PASS, 18 tests
- `pnpm vitest --run tests/unit/tools-registry-indexing.test.ts tests/unit/pwa-shell-assets-contract.test.ts` — PASS, 4 tests
- `pnpm exec eslint 'app/(tools)/pdf-tools/edit/add-page-numbers/page.tsx' 'app/(tools)/pdf-tools/edit/add-page-numbers/opengraph-image.tsx' components/features/pdf-tools/PdfToolsPage.tsx tests/unit/tools-registry-indexing.test.ts` — PASS
- `pnpm typecheck` — PASS
- `pnpm lint` — PASS with existing warnings, 0 errors
- `pnpm build` — PASS

**Production deploy and live checks:**

- First deploy promoted `25b462b9`; second deploy promoted `1744a605`.
- `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh` — PASS on both deploys, including QA gate, VPS build, PM2 restart, nginx cache purge, warmup, and built commit verification.
- Mandatory post-deploy health sequence after the final deploy — PASS:
  - `/api/health` returned OK with database/Redis OK and `commit:"1744a6053de6"`.
  - `/`, `/blog`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/pricing`, `/tools`, `/contract-tools`, `/contract-tools/salon-contract`, `/contract-tools/vehicle-sale`, `/writing-tools/persian-writing-studio` returned HTTP 200.
  - Homepage CSS returned HTTP 200.
  - `Vazirmatn-Bold.woff2` returned HTTP 200.
- Additional live checks:
  - `/api/version` returned version `7.8.0`, commit `1744a6053de6`, branch `main`, builtAt `2026-07-05T10:59:26Z`.
  - `/pdf-tools/edit/add-page-numbers` returned HTTP 200.
  - Live `sw.js` returned HTTP 200 and contains `CACHE_VERSION = 'v11-2026-07-05'` with only `/offline` and `/manifest.webmanifest` in the install shell.
  - PM2 process was online after deploy with memory around 361 MB and CPU below 1% at the post-check sample.
  - Recent nginx `sw.js` log tail showed the broad route burst only before the PWA fix; after deploy, only smoke-test `sw.js` requests were present.

### Follow-up

- Keep monitoring PM2 restart count, heap usage, and nginx logs over normal user traffic for recurrence of route bursts.
- Existing lint warnings remain non-blocking and should be reduced in focused batches.

## 2026-07-05 — CSS recovery after incomplete 7.8.0 deploy, deploy script hardening, full live site testing

**Deployed:** YES (manual recovery + successful `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh`)
**Risk:** MEDIUM (live production CSS breakage + build transient + script changes)
**Production:** https://persiantoolbox.ir
**Deploy command:** manual VPS recovery then `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh`

### Diagnosis & Root Causes

- Live site served HTML referencing old CSS hash (e.g. `0_2agma0chojd.css` → 404) while current build had `2zl7eqzrd30v1.css`.
- Nginx cache (`X-Cache-Status: HIT`) was serving stale HTML from previous build (purge in script used `find -delete || true` which could silently fail).
- `.next/standalone/` was polluted with full source tree (app/, deploy scripts, etc.) from prior bad copy ops — caused BUILD_ID mismatch and asset inconsistency. `ls .next/standalone/` showed 60+ files instead of clean server.js + .next + public.
- During one build attempt: transient OG image prerender timeout (`fetch failed ETIMEDOUT` on date-difference opengraph-image) aborted the build.
- PM2 was serving old process; verification in script had passed in past but state regressed.

### Changes Made

**Live recovery (via SSH):**

- `pm2 stop`, `rm -rf .next`, full rebuild with correct `NODE_OPTIONS`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, `RELEASE_*` envs.
- `rm -rf .next/standalone/.next/static`, `cp -r .next/static ...`, public copy, `chmod -R o+rX`.
- Aggressive cache purge: `find /var/cache/nginx/persiantoolbox -type f -delete`, `rm -rf .../pages .../api`, `mkdir`, `chown www-data`, `nginx -t && reload`.
- `pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js --update-env`, wait health loop, warmup.

**Deploy script hardening (deploy-vps-auto.sh + quick-deploy.sh):**

- Added explicit `server.js` existence check after build.
- `mkdir -p .next/standalone/.next` before static copy.
- Pollution guard: after copy, detect source files (app/, lib/, AGENTS.md, package.json, deploy-\*.sh) in `.next/standalone/` top level and auto `find ... -exec rm -rf`.
- Robust nginx purge:
  - No silent `|| true` hiding sudo errors.
  - Explicit `rm -rf` on subpaths + recreate + `chown www-data`.
  - `nginx -t` check + report success/failure.
  - Echo "Purging nginx cache..." and results.
- Report `X-Cache-Status` during outer verification.
- Better error messages pointing to full script re-run.

**Build resilience:**

- Added `try { new ImageResponse(...) } catch { fallback simple ImageResponse }` in `lib/og-image.tsx:createToolOgImage`.
- Prevents one transient rasterizer/emoji/font/internal fetch error from killing entire production build (866+ pages + OGs).

### Verification Performed (deep live testing)

- Full New Agent Checklist + QA gate (typecheck, lint 0 errors, 1262 vitest tests PASS).
- Post-deploy mandatory sequence: health OK, 10+ key pages 200, CSS/font/worker 200, sitemap/robots 200, www redirect, canonicals.
- Broad status sweeps: all core pages, categories (pdf, date, business, career, writing, seo, contract, validation, finance), flagship tools, SEO tools — 200.
- Content inspection (open_page + grep): no [object Object] on sampled pages, proper H1/titles, schema present (BlogPosting etc.), forms/inputs in tools.
- Headers: CSP, HSTS, security headers good on multiple pages (desktop + mobile UA).
- Server-side (SSH): standalone clean (only expected files), assets counts correct, PM2 online, recent logs analyzed.
- Blog dynamic + articles: 200 + schema.
- 404, redirects, query params, cold vs cached behavior checked.
- Lighthouse production run and archived.

**Findings from testing:**

- Styles now load correctly everywhere (the original user-reported issue resolved).
- Site healthy for users.
- Noted in logs (to monitor/fix later): occasional `client reference manifest` for `/blog/[slug]`, one client-reported React #418 hydration on a text tool (from real mobile UA), 500.html load note.
- Cold starts still 20-40s on heavy pages (blog/tools) — normal but documented.

**Production Lighthouse**
Reports in `docs/release/reports/lighthouse-production-2026-07-05T0950Z/`.

### Notes

- Used `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh` (second attempt succeeded after transient OG timeout in first).
- Pollution guard and improved purge fired/verified during the run.
- All per AGENTS.md rules followed (checklist, gates, no auto-deploy without context, sudo for cache, etc.).

## 2026-07-04 — Commit 782d4638b792

**Deployed:** YES
**Risk:** LOW-MEDIUM (`/loan` client hot-path cleanup plus deploy/monitoring hardening)
**Production:** https://persiantoolbox.ir
**Deploy command:** `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh`

### Changes

- `/loan` now avoids motion wrappers in its primary interactive path and server-renders JSON-LD without `next/script` hydration overhead.
- `deploy-vps-auto.sh` public verification now bypasses local proxy environment variables to avoid false curl failures.
- `health-monitor.sh` now uses a lock, retries transient health failures, and retries CSS/PDF worker checks before alerting.
- VPS cron was de-duplicated so only one health monitor entry runs every 5 minutes.

### Verification

- Local focused QA before commit:
  - `pnpm exec eslint 'app/(tools)/loan/page.tsx' components/features/loan/LoanPage.tsx` — PASS
  - `pnpm vitest --run tests/unit/high-traffic-tools-async-state.test.tsx features/loan/loan.logic.test.ts` — PASS, 14 tests
  - `pnpm typecheck` — PASS
  - `pnpm build` — PASS
- Deploy:
  - `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh` — PASS
  - QA gate passed: typecheck, lint with 288 warnings / 0 errors, vitest, PDF worker check
  - rsync succeeded
  - VPS build succeeded
  - Static assets verified: 1 CSS, 185 JS, 10 fonts, PDF worker present
  - PM2 restarted with `pm2 restart`; process came online
  - Deploy script warmup and verification passed
- Mandatory production health sequence:
  - `/api/health` returned OK with database/Redis OK and `commit:"782d4638b792"`
  - 10 key pages returned HTTP 200
  - Homepage CSS returned HTTP 200
  - `Vazirmatn-Bold.woff2` returned HTTP 200
- Additional live checks:
  - `/api/version` returned version `7.7.0`, commit `782d4638b792`, branch `main`, builtAt `2026-07-04T15:11:56Z`
  - Manual VPS health monitor run completed without restarting PM2
  - The 15:20 UTC cron monitor run completed all clear

Lighthouse Chrome logged `Inspector.targetCrashed` during collection, but exited 0 and produced JSON/HTML reports.

### Follow-up

- Continue `/loan` TBT reduction toward Lighthouse 95+.
- Continue CSP migration from report-only nonce target to enforced nonce/hash policy without breaking Next.js hydration.
- Continue reducing lint warnings in focused batches.
- Restore and verify staging.

### Rollback

- Revert `782d4638b792` and `967ac7da5483` if the `/loan` interaction path regresses, then redeploy with `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh`.
- For monitor-only regressions, revert `782d4638b792` and recopy the previous `health-monitor.sh` to the VPS.
- No database or storage migration was introduced.

## 2026-07-04 — Commit 122ef429746d

**Deployed:** YES
**Risk:** MEDIUM-LOW (release metadata, CSP report-only target, `/loan` bundle deferral, build/lint cleanup)
**Production:** https://persiantoolbox.ir
**Deploy command:** `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh`

### Changes

- Release metadata stamping is live for `/api/version`, `/api/ready`, and `/api/health`.
- CSP report-only nonce target is live alongside the compatible enforced CSP.
- `/loan` secondary saved/share widgets are deferred and render-time form rebuilding/stringifying was reduced.
- Build warning cleanup is deployed.
- Lint warnings reduced from 302 to 288; `no-console` is cleared.

### Verification

- Deploy script:
  - `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh` — PASS
  - QA gate passed: typecheck, lint with 288 warnings / 0 errors, vitest, PDF worker check
  - rsync succeeded
  - VPS build succeeded, 833 pages generated
  - Static assets verified: 1 CSS, 185 JS, 10 fonts, PDF worker present
  - PM2 restarted with `pm2 restart`; process came online
  - Deploy script warmup and verification passed
- Mandatory production health sequence:
  - `/api/health` returned OK with database/Redis OK and `commit:"122ef429746d"`
  - 10 key pages returned HTTP 200
  - Homepage CSS returned HTTP 200
  - `Vazirmatn-Bold.woff2` returned HTTP 200
- Additional live checks:
  - `/api/version` returned version `7.7.0`, commit `122ef429746d`, branch `main`, builtAt `2026-07-04T14:05:34Z`
  - `/api/ready` returned ready with the same release metadata
  - CSP report-only header includes a nonce-backed `script-src` and `style-src`
  - `/loan`, `/sitemap.xml`, and `/robots.txt` returned HTTP 200 on retry after cold start

### Follow-up

- Continue `/loan` performance work; production score is still below target and TBT is high.
- Use CSP report-only violations to plan the next nonce/hash enforcement step.
- Continue reducing lint warnings in focused batches.

## 2026-07-03 — Commit 3051b525 deploy attempt

**Deployed:** NO
**Risk:** LOW (deployment stopped before rsync/server mutation)
**Production:** https://persiantoolbox.ir remained healthy on previous deployed build
**Deploy command:** `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh`

### Changes queued on `main`

- Release metadata stamping for `/api/version`, `/api/ready`, and `/api/health`.
- CSP report-only nonce target without broad `unsafe-inline`.
- `/loan` performance optimization by deferring secondary widgets and reducing render-time rebuilding.
- Build warning cleanup.
- Lint warning cleanup from 302 to 288; `no-console` cleared.

### Verification

- Local pre-deploy gate:
  - `pnpm typecheck` — PASS
  - `pnpm lint` — PASS with 288 warnings, 0 errors
  - `pnpm vitest --run` — PASS, 148 files / 1238 tests
  - `pnpm build` — PASS, 833 pages generated
- Deploy script gate:
  - `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh` — QA gate PASS on both attempts
  - Both attempts failed at `=== Step 1: Rsync files ===`
  - Error: `ssh: connect to host 193.93.169.32 port 22: Connection timed out`
- Connectivity checks:
  - `ssh -i /home/dev13/.ssh/id_ed25519 -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=10 ubuntu@193.93.169.32 'echo ok'` — FAIL, timeout
  - `nc -vz -w 10 193.93.169.32 22` — FAIL, timeout
  - `curl https://persiantoolbox.ir/api/health` — PASS, production healthy
  - `curl https://persiantoolbox.ir/api/version` — returned `commit:null`, confirming the new build is not deployed

### Follow-up

- Restore SSH reachability to `193.93.169.32:22`.
- Rerun `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh`.
- After deploy, run the mandatory production health sequence, verify `/api/version` exposes commit/branch/build time, then run and archive production Lighthouse.

## 2026-07-02 — Local build warning cleanup

**Deployed:** NO
**Risk:** LOW (build configuration and lockfile maintenance only)

### Changes

- Removed the redundant custom `Cache-Control` header for `/_next/static/:path*`; Next.js owns immutable static chunk caching.
- Updated Browserslist data through `pnpm dlx update-browserslist-db@latest`.
- Added a narrow `outputFileTracingExcludes` entry for `/api/admin/ops/logs` so Turbopack no longer traces `next.config.mjs` into that route's NFT list.

### Verification

- `pnpm build` — PASS, 833 pages generated.
- Confirmed the stale Browserslist warning, custom Cache-Control warning, and Turbopack NFT trace warning are gone.
- Existing unrelated Next notice remains: using edge runtime on a page disables static generation for that page.

### Follow-up

- Include this cleanup in the next approved deployment.

## 2026-07-02 — Commit 6608314e

**Deployed:** YES
**Risk:** MEDIUM-LOW (SEO/UX/a11y QA fixes plus CSP compatibility change)
**Production:** https://persiantoolbox.ir
**Deploy command:** `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh`

### Changes

- Final SEO/UX/accessibility QA fixes for homepage and important tool pages.
- Image resize page received a meaningful H1 and intro copy.
- Mobile nav closed state now uses `inert`.
- Enamad seal links received accessible labels.
- Dark-mode contrast and heading order issues fixed.
- Blog/toast/loading mobile overflow risks fixed.
- Tool-count consistency locked to registry `97`, active `87`, display/indexable `86`, label `۸۶`.
- CSP adjusted for verified Next.js hydration; still uses `unsafe-inline`.

### Verification

- Pre-deploy local QA:
  - `pnpm typecheck` — PASS
  - `pnpm lint` — PASS with 302 warnings, 0 errors
  - `pnpm build` — PASS, 833 pages generated
  - `pnpm vitest --run` — PASS, 1235 tests
- Deploy:
  - `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh` — PASS
  - PM2 `persiantoolbox` restarted successfully
  - New process ready on attempt 8
  - Deploy script warmup and verification passed
- Live production checks:
  - `/api/health` returned OK with database and Redis OK
  - `/` and `/loan` returned HTTP 200
  - `www` root, `/loan`, and `/loan?x=1` redirected to non-www with path/query preserved
  - `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` returned HTTP 200
  - Homepage canonical: `https://persiantoolbox.ir`
  - `/loan` canonical: `https://persiantoolbox.ir/loan`
  - Homepage and `/loan` `[object Object]` count: `0`
  - `/api/version` returned version `7.7.0` and `commit:null`

### Warnings / Follow-up

- Production commit hash is UNVERIFIED from the app because `/api/version` returns `commit:null`.
- CSP enforced policy still uses `unsafe-inline` for static Next.js compatibility. Local code adds a nonce-backed report-only target; use its violations to migrate inline hydration/JSON-LD/style usage before enforcing nonce/hash CSP.
- Production Lighthouse after deploy is UNVERIFIED.
- Previous local Lighthouse `/loan` Performance score was `78`; local optimization is prepared and still needs approved deploy plus fresh production Lighthouse.
- Existing lint warnings remain non-blocking: 288 total after local cleanup (`no-non-null-assertion` 182, `no-nested-ternary` 85, `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` 10, `no-img-element` 11). `no-console` is cleared.
- The named build warnings are resolved locally: stale Browserslist data was updated, redundant custom Cache-Control was removed, and the Turbopack NFT trace warning was suppressed with a narrow trace exclude. The unrelated edge-runtime static-generation notice remains.

### Rollback

- Revert commit `6608314e` and redeploy with `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh`.
- No database or storage migration was introduced.

## 2026-07-02 — Commit 98512d4b

**Deployed:** YES
**Risk:** LOW (homepage/content/navigation additions only)
**Production:** https://persiantoolbox.ir

### Changes

- Homepage growth pass for free-tool positioning.
- Standardized homepage/live SEO copy around the verified «۸۶ ابزار رایگان» count.
- Added role-based homepage paths for finance/admin users, small businesses, PDF/file users, and writers/students.
- Added direct tool links inside each role path to reduce time-to-tool.
- Updated homepage copy and e2e/unit coverage for the new section.

### Verification

- Local QA before deploy:
  - `pnpm typecheck`
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm vitest --run` — 147 files, 1,234 tests passed
  - `pnpm build` — 825 pages generated
- Deploy:
  - `bash deploy-vps-auto.sh`
  - VPS build completed; PM2 `persiantoolbox` restarted with `pm2 restart`
  - deploy script warmup and verification passed
- Live production checks:
  - `/api/health` returned `{"status":"ok"}` with database and redis OK
  - 10 key pages returned HTTP 200
  - live CSS chunk returned HTTP 200
  - `Vazirmatn-Bold.woff2` returned HTTP 200
  - homepage HTML contains:
    - «۸۶ ابزار رایگان»
    - «مسیر پیشنهادی برای هر نوع کاربر»
    - «کسب‌وکار کوچک، فروشگاه و فریلنسر»

### Warnings / Follow-up

- Existing lint warnings remain non-blocking but should be reduced in admin/API code:
  `no-nested-ternary`, `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`, `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion`.
- Existing build warnings remain non-blocking:
  custom `Cache-Control` for `/_next/static/:path*`, stale Browserslist data, and Turbopack NFT trace warning from admin ops logs route.
- Staging remains down and should be restored separately with `deploy-staging.sh`.
- PM2 restart count is elevated and needs log-based root-cause review.

### Rollback

- Revert commit `98512d4b` and redeploy.
- No database or storage migration was introduced by this homepage change.

## 2026-06-27 — Commit e6243ae

**Deployed:** YES
**Risk:** LOW (additive changes only)

### Changes

- Revenue hardening: transaction-safe credit reserve, stale cleanup, failure refund
- Legacy resume route 301 redirect
- Legacy registry entry marked non-indexable

### DB Changes

- None (tables already exist from previous migration)

### Risks

- Transaction-safe reserve may briefly hold row lock during concurrent exports (acceptable)
- 301 redirect removes legacy route from sitemap (intentional — reduces duplicate content)
- No data loss, no destructive operations

### Rollback

- Revert commit to restore previous behavior
- Legacy redirect removal: just remove the entry from `next.config.mjs` redirects

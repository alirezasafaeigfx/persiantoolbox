## Notes

- Historical noise, non-operational docs, and completed checklists were moved to `docs/archive/`.
- Generated log dumps under `docs/deployment/reports/logs/` were removed.
- Some operational reports are kept for auditability. For day-to-day onboarding,
  prefer the Start Here section over reading historical reports.

## Docs Maintenance Rule

- Generated documents/contracts are source-of-truth and must pass `pnpm docs:auto:check`.
- Hand-written docs are: `README.md`, `DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md`, `USER-GUIDE.md`, `env-guide.md`, `brand-assets-guide.md`, `security-audit.md`.
- When behavior/config/routes change, update docs in the same pull request.
